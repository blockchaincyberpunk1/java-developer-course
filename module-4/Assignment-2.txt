Multithreaded Image Processing
Objective: To apply multithreading concepts in a real-world scenario.

Task: In this assignment, you will be presented with an image processing task, and your objective is to parallelize the task using Java's multithreading capabilities. This assignment will demonstrate how multithreading can significantly improve the speed of image processing tasks, which are often computationally intensive.

Instructions:

Image Processing Task: You will receive an image file that you need to process. The image processing task could involve applying various filters, transformations, or enhancements to the image. The specific image processing operation will depend on the assignment variant provided by your instructor.

Multithreading: Your task is to implement a multithreaded solution to perform the image processing task. You should divide the image into smaller segments or chunks and assign each segment to a separate thread for parallel processing. Ensure that the threads work concurrently to process their assigned segments.

Thread Coordination: You must manage the coordination of threads, ensuring that they correctly process their assigned image segments without conflicts or race conditions.

Performance Improvement: Measure and compare the execution time of the multithreaded solution against a single-threaded solution (provided as a reference). Your goal is to demonstrate that the multithreaded approach significantly improves performance.

Testing: Thoroughly test your multithreaded image processing solution with different images and scenarios to ensure correct results and performance improvements.

Documentation: Include comments and documentation in your code to explain the multithreading strategy, thread coordination mechanisms used, and how the image processing task is divided among threads.

Assignment Variants: Depending on your course instructor's choice, the image processing task may involve operations like applying filters, resizing, rotating, or enhancing images.

Submission: Submit the source code file (.java) for your multithreaded image processing implementation, including any additional documentation.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness: Your multithreaded solution should correctly process the image according to the specified image processing task.

Multithreading Implementation: Your code should effectively use Java's multithreading capabilities to parallelize the image processing task.

Performance Improvement: You should demonstrate a significant improvement in performance (execution time) compared to a single-threaded solution.

Testing: Thorough testing should be conducted to verify the correctness and performance of the multithreaded image processing solution.

Documentation: The code should include comments and documentation explaining the multithreading strategy, thread coordination mechanisms, and how the image processing task is divided among threads.

Submission: The assignment should be submitted with the required source code file and any additional documentation.
