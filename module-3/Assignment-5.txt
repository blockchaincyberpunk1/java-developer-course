 Error Management in a Multithreaded Application
Objective: To explore error management in multithreaded Java applications.

Task: In this assignment, you will work with a multithreaded Java application that simulates concurrent tasks. Your task is to identify and handle potential race conditions or synchronization issues in the application. Additionally, you should implement exception handling mechanisms to ensure thread safety and proper error management.

Instructions:

Multithreaded Application: You will be provided with a multithreaded Java application that performs a specific task concurrently using multiple threads. The application might involve shared resources, data synchronization, and communication among threads.

Identify Potential Issues: Review the provided code and identify potential issues related to concurrency, race conditions, or synchronization. Look for areas where multiple threads might access shared data or resources simultaneously without proper synchronization.

Exception Handling: Implement exception handling mechanisms to handle errors and exceptions that can occur during concurrent execution. Consider using Java's built-in exception handling features, such as try-catch blocks and synchronization constructs.

Thread Safety: Ensure that your modifications make the application thread-safe, preventing data corruption or unexpected behavior caused by concurrent access to shared resources.

Testing: Thoroughly test your modified application to verify that it handles concurrent execution correctly and gracefully manages errors and exceptions. Test it with various scenarios to simulate real-world multithreaded situations.

Documentation: Include comments and documentation in your code to explain the changes you made, the concurrency issues you addressed, and how you handled errors and exceptions.

Submission: Submit the modified source code file (.java) for the multithreaded application, along with any additional documentation.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Identification of Issues: You should accurately identify potential concurrency, race condition, or synchronization issues in the provided multithreaded application.

Exception Handling: Your modifications should include effective exception handling mechanisms to manage errors and exceptions that may occur during concurrent execution.

Thread Safety: The modified application should demonstrate thread safety and prevent data corruption or unexpected behavior caused by concurrent access to shared resources.

Testing: Thorough testing should be conducted to ensure that the application handles concurrent execution correctly and gracefully manages errors.

Documentation: The code should include comments and documentation that explain the changes made, concurrency issues addressed, and error management strategies implemented.

Submission: The assignment should be submitted with the required modified source code file and any additional documentation.
