Test Automation
Objective: To explore automated testing practices and tools.

Task: Automated testing is a crucial part of modern software development. In this assignment, you will select a Java project of your choice (e.g., a command-line application or a small web application) and develop a suite of automated tests using JUnit. You should write tests for different components, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. This assignment will allow you to practice and demonstrate your understanding of test automation.

Follow these steps:

Project Selection:

Choose an existing Java project for this assignment. You can select an open-source project, a personal project, or a project provided by your instructor.
Test Framework Setup:

Set up the necessary testing framework and tools for your selected project. Ensure that you have JUnit and any other required libraries or testing tools properly configured.
Unit Testing:

Identify individual units or components within your project (e.g., classes or methods) that can be tested in isolation. Write unit tests for these components using JUnit.
Ensure that your unit tests cover different scenarios, including valid inputs, edge cases, and potential error conditions.
Use JUnit's assertion methods to validate the expected behavior of your components.
Integration Testing:

Identify interactions between different components of your project that need to be tested together. Write integration tests to validate these interactions.
Integration tests should focus on ensuring that different parts of your project work correctly when combined.
Use JUnit or other testing frameworks to set up and run these integration tests.
End-to-End Testing:

If your project has a user interface (e.g., a web interface or a command-line interface), write end-to-end tests that simulate user interactions.
Use testing tools like Selenium (for web applications) or libraries like TestFX (for JavaFX applications) to automate user interactions and validate the behavior of the entire application.
Test Coverage:

Aim for comprehensive test coverage to ensure that your tests exercise most, if not all, parts of your project's code.
Use tools like JaCoCo or your IDE's built-in code coverage reports to analyze test coverage and identify areas that may need additional testing.
Continuous Integration (Optional):

If possible, set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline for your project. Platforms like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions can automatically run your tests whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
Documentation:

In your project's documentation, include information on how to run the tests, interpret test results, and contribute to the test suite.
Submission: You are not required to submit this assignment. However, you should be prepared to showcase your test suite and testing practices to your instructor or peers as part of a presentation or code review.
