Servlet-JSP Integration
Objective: To demonstrate the integration of Servlets and JSP.

Task: In this assignment, you will create a web application that combines Servlets and JSP to build a registration system. Servlets will handle user registration logic, while JSP pages will display user information.

Assignment Instructions:

Set Up Your Development Environment: Ensure that you have a Java development environment with a servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat) installed.

Create a New Dynamic Web Project: Start by creating a new dynamic web project in your chosen IDE (e.g., Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).

Design a User Registration Form (JSP): Create a JSP page (e.g., registration.jsp) that contains a user registration form. The form should collect information such as the user's name, email address, and password.

Servlet for Registration Logic: Create a Servlet (e.g., RegistrationServlet) that handles the user registration logic. This servlet should listen to a specific URL (e.g., /register) and process POST requests sent from the registration form.

Servlet-JSP Communication: When the user submits the registration form, the Servlet should process the form data and store it (e.g., in-memory or in a database). After successful registration, the Servlet should forward the request to a JSP page (e.g., registration-success.jsp) along with the user's registration details.

Display Registration Success (JSP): In the registration-success.jsp page, use JSP tags and expressions to display a message confirming the successful registration and show the user's registration details, such as their name and email address.

Validation and Error Handling (Optional): Optionally, you can add client-side or server-side validation to ensure that the user's input is correct and complete. Implement error handling to display appropriate error messages if registration fails.

Testing: Deploy your web application on the servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) and access the registration form through a web browser. Test the functionality by submitting the form with various inputs to ensure successful registration and error handling.

Documentation: Include comments and documentation in your code to explain how the Servlet and JSP pages work together to handle user registration.

Submission: Submit the source code for your Servlets and JSP pages, along with any additional documentation.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Integration of Servlets and JSP: Effective integration of Servlets and JSP to create a functional registration system.

User Input Handling: Proper handling of user input by the Servlet and validation (if applicable).

Servlet-JSP Communication: Successful communication between the Servlet and JSP pages to display registration information.

Validation (if applicable): If you include validation, it should correctly check and handle errors in user input.

Testing: Thorough testing should be conducted to verify the correctness of your registration system.

Documentation: Include comments and documentation in your code to explain how the Servlet and JSP pages work together to handle user registration.

Submission: The assignment should be submitted with the required source code files (Servlets and JSP pages) and any additional documentation.
