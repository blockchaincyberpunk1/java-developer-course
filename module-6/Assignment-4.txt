Advanced Desktop GUI Application (JavaFX)
Objective: To explore more advanced GUI development with JavaFX.

Task: In this assignment, you will create an advanced desktop application with a rich graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX. This assignment is designed to challenge you to build a feature-rich application that showcases JavaFX's capabilities for creating modern and interactive user interfaces.

Assignment Instructions:

Choose an Advanced Application Type: Select the type of advanced desktop application you want to create using JavaFX. Here are a few ideas:

Multimedia Player: Develop a multimedia player capable of playing audio and video files. Implement features like play, pause, volume control, and playlist management.
Image Editor: Create a versatile image editing application with tools for cropping, resizing, applying filters, and other image manipulation features.
Music or Video Streaming App: Build an app that allows users to stream and enjoy music or video content. Implement playlists, search, and playback controls.
Drawing or Design Tool: Design a creative drawing or graphic design application with various tools and customization options.
Any other application that interests you and demonstrates JavaFX's capabilities.
Use JavaFX: Implement the GUI of your application using JavaFX components. Leverage JavaFX's features for creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

Advanced Functionality: Your application should offer advanced features and functionality based on its type. For example:

For a multimedia player, it should support various multimedia formats, display metadata, and have a user-friendly interface.
For an image editor, it should provide a wide range of image manipulation tools and support common image file formats.
For a streaming app, it should stream content efficiently, provide recommendations, and allow users to create playlists.
For a drawing tool, it should offer a variety of drawing tools, colors, and export options.
User Interaction: Implement advanced user interaction features that enhance the user experience. Include interactive components and gestures where applicable.

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected scenarios gracefully. Provide meaningful error messages when necessary.

Design and Layout: Pay attention to the design and layout of your application. Utilize JavaFX's layout managers (e.g., VBox, HBox, GridPane) to organize components effectively.

Documentation: Include comments and documentation in your code to explain the functionality of different components and classes.

Testing: Rigorously test your advanced desktop application to ensure all features work as expected, and the user interface is responsive and visually appealing.

User Guide: Create a comprehensive user guide or README that explains how to use your application, including all its advanced features and functionality.

Submission: Submit the source code of your JavaFX application along with any required resources (e.g., multimedia files, images) and the user guide or README.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Application Type: The chosen advanced application type should be relevant and demonstrate JavaFX's capabilities effectively.

JavaFX Usage: Effective use of JavaFX components to build a rich and interactive GUI.

Advanced Functionality: The application should offer advanced and relevant features based on its type.

User Interaction: Implementation of advanced user interaction features that enhance the user experience.

Error Handling: Robust error handling to manage unexpected scenarios gracefully.

Design and Layout: A well-organized and visually appealing design and layout.

Documentation: Clear code comments and a comprehensive user guide or README.

Testing: Thorough testing to ensure all advanced features work as expected.
