Final Project (Optional)
Objective: To allow students to apply their Java skills to a substantial desktop application.

Task: This assignment is the culmination of your Java Developer course. It provides you with the opportunity to design and build a complete desktop application of your choice. This project should be a showcase of your Java skills, incorporating advanced features, data persistence, and a well-designed user interface. It's a chance for you to demonstrate your ability to create a real-world Java application.

Assignment Instructions:

Project Selection: Choose a project idea that genuinely interests you and aligns with your learning objectives. Your project should involve substantial Java programming and demonstrate your mastery of desktop application development. Here are some project ideas to consider:

Personal Finance Manager: Create an application that allows users to track income, expenses, and budgets. Implement data visualization and financial analysis features.
Task or Project Management Tool: Develop a comprehensive task or project management application with features like task creation, assignment, scheduling, and progress tracking.
Inventory Management System: Build an application for managing product inventory, including features like adding, updating, and tracking inventory items.
Note-taking or Journaling App: Create a feature-rich note-taking or journaling application with text formatting, search, and organization capabilities.
Weather Forecast App: Build an application that retrieves and displays weather forecasts for user-specified locations.
E-commerce Application: Design a simplified e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add items to a cart, and complete purchases (simulate transactions).
Any other project that aligns with your interests and showcases your skills.
Technical Requirements: Your project must meet the following technical requirements:

Implement a well-designed graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX, based on your project's requirements and complexity.
Utilize data persistence techniques such as file I/O or a relational database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) to store and retrieve data relevant to your application.
Include advanced features and functionality that make your application unique and useful.
Implement error handling to manage unexpected scenarios gracefully.
Create a user-friendly experience with attention to design and usability.
Provide clear documentation that explains how to use your application, including any installation or setup instructions.
Project Planning: Before diving into coding, create a project plan that outlines the following:

Project scope and objectives.
A detailed feature list.
A timeline or schedule for development tasks.
Resources and libraries you'll use (e.g., Java libraries, external APIs).
Data modeling or database schema (if applicable).
Design mockups or wireframes of your application's user interface.
Development: Start developing your project based on your plan. Break down the development tasks into manageable milestones or sprints, focusing on one feature or functionality at a time. Be sure to follow best practices for coding, documentation, and testing.

Testing: Rigorously test your application to ensure that it works as expected, and that all features are functional. Pay attention to both functionality and usability during testing.

Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation that includes the following:

An overview of your project's purpose and functionality.
Detailed instructions on how to install and run your application.
Explanations of key features and how to use them.
Any dependencies or prerequisites.
Any known issues or limitations.
Presentation (Optional): If applicable, prepare a presentation or demonstration of your project to showcase its features and functionality to your instructor and peers.

Submission: Submit the complete source code of your Java project along with any required resources (e.g., database files) and the documentation.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your final project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Project Scope and Complexity: The scope of your project and its complexity should align with your level of expertise and course objectives.

Technical Implementation: Effective use of Java Swing or JavaFX for GUI, data persistence techniques, and advanced features.

Error Handling: Robust error handling and graceful management of unexpected scenarios.

User Interface Design: A well-designed, user-friendly interface that enhances the user experience.

Documentation: Comprehensive documentation that helps users understand and use your application.

Testing: Thorough testing to ensure all features work as expected.

Creativity and Innovation: Creativity in the implementation of features and innovation in addressing real-world problems.

Presentation (if applicable): Clarity and effectiveness of the presentation or demonstration (if required).
