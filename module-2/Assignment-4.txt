Inheritance and Polymorphism
Objective: To explore inheritance and polymorphism in Java.

Task: In this assignment, you will delve into the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in Java by creating a hierarchy of classes representing different animals. Each class should have common attributes and methods inherited from a base class, and they can also include subclass-specific attributes and methods. Finally, you will demonstrate polymorphism by creating an array of animals and calling their methods.

Instructions:

Class Hierarchy: Create a class hierarchy for animals. Start with a base class called Animal. Animal should have the following attributes and methods:

Attributes:

name (String): The name of the animal.
age (int): The age of the animal.
Methods:

makeSound(): A method that prints the sound the animal makes. For example, "Animal makes a sound."
Subclasses: Create at least three subclasses of Animal representing specific types of animals. For example, you can have classes like Dog, Cat, and Bird. Each subclass should:

Include additional attributes specific to that type of animal (e.g., Dog might have a breed attribute).
Override the makeSound() method to provide a unique sound for that animal type.
Polymorphism: In your Main class (the main program), do the following:

Create an array of Animal objects.
Instantiate objects of the different animal types (e.g., Dog, Cat) and add them to the array.
Iterate through the array and call the makeSound() method for each animal.
Documentation: Provide comments and documentation in your code to explain the purpose of each class, attribute, and method.

Testing: Test your program to ensure that it correctly demonstrates polymorphism, and that each animal type makes its unique sound.

Submission: Submit the source code files (.java) along with a brief explanation of the class hierarchy, your approach to implementing inheritance and polymorphism, and the output generated by your program.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Class Hierarchy: The class hierarchy should include a base class (Animal) with common attributes and methods, and subclasses representing specific animal types.

Attributes and Methods: Each class should have appropriate attributes and methods, and they should be well-defined and relevant to the class.

Polymorphism: The program should demonstrate polymorphism by creating an array of Animal objects and calling the makeSound() method for each animal.

Correctness: The program should produce the correct output, with each animal type making its unique sound.

Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, follow Java naming conventions, and include comments and documentation.

Submission: The assignment should be submitted with all required source code files and explanations.
