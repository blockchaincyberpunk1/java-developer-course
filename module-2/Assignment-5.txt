Exception Handling
Objective: To introduce error handling using exception handling in Java.

Task: In this assignment, you will explore exception handling in Java by working with a program that intentionally generates exceptions. Your task is to modify the program to catch and handle these exceptions gracefully, providing appropriate error messages.

Instructions:

Starter Program: You will be provided with a Java program that contains intentional exceptions. The program might perform operations like division by zero or access elements of an array out of bounds, causing exceptions to be thrown.

Exception Handling: Your task is to identify the specific exceptions that are being thrown and catch them using appropriate try-catch blocks. Handle each exception gracefully by providing informative error messages to the user. For example, if a division by zero exception occurs, you should catch it and display a message like "Cannot divide by zero."

Multiple Exceptions: The starter program may contain multiple places where exceptions can occur. Ensure that you catch and handle each type of exception separately. Use multiple catch blocks if necessary.

Testing: Test your modified program by deliberately causing exceptions (e.g., providing invalid input) to ensure that the exceptions are caught and appropriate error messages are displayed.

Documentation: Provide comments and documentation in your code to explain the purpose of each try-catch block and the type of exception it is handling.

Submission: Submit the source code file (.java) along with a brief explanation of the exceptions you encountered, the error messages you provided, and how you handled each exception.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Exception Handling: The program should correctly catch and handle exceptions that occur during its execution.

Error Messages: Error messages should be informative and relevant to the type of exception caught.

Multiple Exceptions: If the starter program contains multiple places where exceptions can occur, each type of exception should be handled separately.

Testing: The program should be tested to ensure that exceptions are caught and appropriate error messages are displayed when needed.

Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, follow Java naming conventions, and include comments and documentation.

Submission: The assignment should be submitted with the required source code file and explanations of the exceptions encountered and how they were handled.
