JSP Fundamentals
Objective: To familiarize students with JavaServer Pages (JSP).

Task: In this assignment, you will create a JavaServer Pages (JSP) page that dynamically generates HTML content based on user input. JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology used for developing web-based applications in Java. This assignment will help you understand how to integrate Java code into web pages to generate dynamic content.

Assignment Instructions:

Set Up Your Development Environment: Ensure that you have a Java development environment with a servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat) installed.

Create a New Dynamic Web Project: Start by creating a new dynamic web project in your chosen IDE (e.g., Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).

Create a JSP Page: Create a JSP page (e.g., userInput.jsp) in your web project. This page will contain both HTML and JSP code.

Design a Web Form: Within your JSP page, design a web form that takes user input. For example, you can include fields for the user's name and email address.

Handle User Input: Use JSP tags and expressions to retrieve and display the user's input. For instance, you can use <% ... %> scriptlet tags to write Java code that processes the form data and displays it on the page.

Validation (Optional): Optionally, you can add client-side or server-side validation to ensure that the user's input is correct and complete. For example, check if the email address is in a valid format.

Dynamic HTML Generation: Your JSP page should dynamically generate HTML content based on the user's input. For example, you can display a personalized greeting message like "Hello, [user's name]!" or an email confirmation.

Testing: Deploy your web application on the servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) and access the JSP page through a web browser. Test the functionality by entering different values in the form fields and observing the dynamically generated HTML content.

Documentation: Include comments and documentation in your JSP page to explain how it processes user input and generates HTML content.

Submission: Submit the source code for your JSP page, along with any additional documentation.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

JSP Functionality: Your JSP page should correctly process user input and generate dynamic HTML content.

User Input Handling: Effective use of JSP tags and expressions to handle user input and generate content.

Validation (if applicable): If you include validation, it should correctly check and handle errors in user input.

Dynamic HTML Generation: The JSP page should dynamically generate HTML content based on user input.

Testing: Thorough testing should be conducted to verify the correctness of your JSP page.

Documentation: Include comments and documentation in your JSP page to explain how it processes user input and generates HTML content.

Submission: The assignment should be submitted with the required source code files (JSP page) and any additional documentation.
